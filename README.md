# Check-BTC-Value

Before running the program for the first time:
  #1 Enter your own api key for https://coinmarketcap.com/
  #2 Insert an mp3 file in the same folder as the python file.
  #3 Write the name of the mp3 file in the code. (Has been commented on where it should be)

When all is done you can run the program :)
